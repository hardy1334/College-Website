             <b>Objectives</b>
             <p>The chapter was initiated with a goal to generate curiosity among the students for impending technologies in computer science apart from the regular course content.</p>
             <h5>Various timely activities are organized and operated exclusively for educational and scientific purposes in order to:</h5>
             <ul>
                 <li>Increase and improvise the knowledge of upcoming research fields in science, design, development, languages, management.</li>
                 <li>Improve interest in computing and its applications.</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Many students have been inspired to be a part of the National-level event 'Learn 'n'' Code and 'Innovaci'' on', an event on presentation skills. These events saw members of the society and non-members gather on a common platform to check their learning and analytical skills.</p>
             <p>ACM believes in 'Learning by Doing', standing by this motto, workshops on Android 'Application Development' were organised and a six-day workshop on 'Programming with Python' was conducted. Student members who were well versed taught other students the art of developing algorithms using real life examples.</p>
