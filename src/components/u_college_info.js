In the times when skills speak more than anything for a technical graduate, Chitkara and Udacity will provide the ideal environment and courses, which help develop professional qualities.

             This collaboration will bring students closer to the right set of skills needed and they will be at same pace with the industry. The initiative will help master in-demand skills. Build and design amazing projects. Earn a valued scredential. Launch career in Data Science, Machine Learning, Android, iOS, and more. Be in demand!
             </p>
