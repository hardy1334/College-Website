              <p>The MUN conferences are all about acquiring an in-depth knowledge of pressing issues, through research and examination that would help them deliberate and form resolutions by creating a balance between national interests and interests of the international community.</p>
              <p>Each year the event brings together hundreds of young leaders from across the nation, to debate upon issues that plague the world we live in and strive to come up with innovative solutions to the same. Our students believe that each one of them has the power to bring about the change they wish to see and with this spirit they have emerged as one of the best participants at Model United Nations year after year.</p>
